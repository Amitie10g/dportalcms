the following message or similar (specficaly in 'blog.php'):

-----------------------------------------------------------
	Warning: Unknown: Your script possibly relies on a
	session side-effect which existed until PHP 4.2.3.
	Please be advised that the session extension
	does not consider global variables as a source of
	data, unless register_globals is enabled.

	You can disable this functionality and this
	warning by setting session.bug_compat_42 or
	session.bug_compat_warn	to off, respectively
	in Unknown on line 0
-----------------------------------------------------------

This may be a Bug in code, but is NOT a critical Error; only
is a Warning about using incorrect Global variable unset.

This error has been fixed in this program. If you see them,
please report.
