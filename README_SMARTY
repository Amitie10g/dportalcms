DPortal CMS - Smarty variable declarations

= About Smarty 3 =

Smarty 3 is the next version of this Template engine,
with new features, but backwards compatible.

DPortal CMS was tested with Smarty3 beta, and may cause problems with
Arrays into templates:

{$variable['value']} <= cause error on compilation.

I'm testing the aplication with Smarty3. I strongly recomended to NO
use Smarty3 instead of Smarty2. I'm warned them!

And finally, Smarty3 is ONLY compatible with PHP5.


= About Smarty vaiables and Functions in Templates =

Smarty uses single-braces {$variable} in Templates for declaring
Variables or Fuctions by default.

This program is configured to use double-braces '{{}}' in templates,
for compatibility and PORTABILITY reasons, and in order to display
and parse correctly client-side scripts (as javascript or CSS)
without changing the Code by adding {rdelim}, {ldelim}
or inclusive {literal}; these are not dissirable and PHP
-and any other as templates- code should be PORTABLE and CLEAR.

This is more easy and efficient to use double-braces than altering
the code in a template with Javascript. Therefore, these Scripts may
contain Dynamic portions for configuration, and a
{literal} arruinates the code!

So, don't forgot to use double-braces when using Smarty variables
in your templates inside this program!
