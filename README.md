# DPortal CMS
This was a project to make a simple, very basic CMS without database. It uses Smarty (TM) and FPDF (included but outdated). I left the project due my studies and I'm not longer maintain it.

The website was hosted at http://dportalcms.org (now death and available at Internet Archive) and ran DPortal CMS. It is enough stable and secure to be used as CMS, but requires huge improvement and upgrading. Feel free to fork and improve it.
