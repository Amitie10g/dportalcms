; :: Book Categories and Generes, updated automatically
;
; Overview and isntructions to update manually:
;
; The Table `book_categories` has the following two fields: `category` and `genere`
;
; This file contains the translation of Categories and Generes. Prefix are 'book_cat_' for
; Categories and 'book_gen_' for Generes. Exception is the Row 0, that is used as the 'Select'
; leyend in Selection Menu, and is disabled and will be ignored.
;
; Here has four Categories. You shouldn't add more Categories unless you know doing.
; To add category, you should add bellow (and in all the Language file) first, as the following:
; 'book_cat_cate', where 'cate' is the four-letter code for Category.
;
; Each Category have Generes. To add Generes, add here (and in all the Language files), under
; the correspondient Category (but not necesary in order) as the following:
; 'book_gen_cate_terror' where 'cate is the four-letter' code for the Category, and 'terror'
; is a Genere code example. To add a miscelaneous Genere, codename should be 'z_other'.
; Why 'z_other'. Well, 'z' is the last letter in alphabet, and will be the last option in
; Menu. When sorting with asort(), these will be the last option.
;
; Then, add to the DB. As I mentioned bellow, DB has two fields (plus the ID that you
; should't touch!). In `category`, add the four-letter code of Category, and `genere` add
; the Genere codename.
;
; Order of Categories and Generes (and ID) is not important. When get the String,
; also will get the ID that will be used to send the ID of Category when creating a Book.
; Order of Categories and Generes will be done in Function using array_multisort(), because
; setting the Order ins the SQL Query string may not obtain expected results, and 
; asort() is more flexible to order data form Array.
