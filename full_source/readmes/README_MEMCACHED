= About Memcached support =

Memcached is a high performance memory based caching, to improve performance
on Wensites with high volume of traffic, specially when using Databases. Most
great Websites as Slashdot and Wikipedia, and most CMS use Memcached.

To enable Memcached support in DPortal CMS, your Webserver should have
installed the Memcached libraries and the PECL extension installed.

Memcached support can be enabled during installation, or in the Control Panel.
By default, Memcached server is "localhost" and the default port is 11211. You
should provide these parameters in order to enable them. If you leave these
parameters empty or with incorrect data, memcached support will be disabled
and the default Caching-on-Files will be used.
