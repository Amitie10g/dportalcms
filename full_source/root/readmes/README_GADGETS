= Notes and warnings =

	Note: This feature is currently in developement,
	and may be available in a future release. If you want
	to create Gadgets, you can create manually the File
	in 'smarty/templates directory' and use the {include}
	or {fetch} function in 'sidebar_c.tpl' for example

	IMPORTANT: PLEASE SEE 'README_SMARTY' DOCUMENT!

= About Gadgets and other codes in Sidebar =

With this CMS, you can crate your own Gadgets, and save them as Templates.
These will be included in 'sidebar_c.tpl' as the following:

sidebar_c.tpl
----------------------------------------------------
	{include file="gadget1.tpl"}
	{include file="gadget2.tpl"}
----------------------------------------------------

You can change the order the Gadgets in the Template.

From the panel, you can create the Gadget file. This must have
a Name and Title. The Name must be only alphanumerical.

Technicaly:

Gadgets are saved as template in 'smarty/templates'
I created a function similar to {fetch}, but contains
information about Title too.

----------------------------------------------------
	{INCLUDE_GADGET name='mygadget' title='My Gadget'}
----------------------------------------------------

Note that in name don't have Extension, because is added
in Fuction before Fetching the Contents of file.

This function use the file_get_contents() function to get the
contents, and is Cached as part the 'sidebar_c.tpl' Template file.

How to change the order of gadgets in Sidebar?

Simply. By editing the template 'sidebar_c.tpl', and
change the position of the Custom function.

How to get the Gadgets for a Loop?

The name of a gadget is 'gadget.mygadget.tpl'. Using the same
loop (variable), I create other {section} block as the used
in Edit 'Templates manually', but this prints Form and Textarea,
when you can Edit the content of the Gadget, in panel.
