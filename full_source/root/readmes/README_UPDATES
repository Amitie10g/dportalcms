This program is in developement, and may contain bugs.

After downloading and installing the distribution, you should update
the code via SVN. See README_UPDATES_SVN for details.

At 04/11/2010, the following modules included and the state are:

* Main module: OK.
	
		* Create		[OK, see bellow]
		* Edit			[OK]
		* Delete		[OK]
		* Manage Categories	[Working]

	Note: When the administrator creates a new Section, creates a
	Empty section file, that should not be be desplayed.
	Currently, the Function outputs a Text to the File, that shown
	to User than this section is newly created.

	If the Admin send Empty content or empty title, the Script
	returns to the Editor, and warns to Admin. This is a major
	bugfix.

* Blog: OK.
	
	All functions operate porperly

	* Create	[OK]
	* Edit		[OK]
	* Delete	[OK]

	All major and minor bugs fixed.

* Gallery: OK

	Functions for Display and Create are written. Functions for
	manage will be created soon.

	Is desirable than the Thumbnail displayed in Index be a
	Random image. Currently, only Last image uploaded is displayed,
	but another function used in Videos will be used for them, too.

	* Main Index 		[OK]
	* Display		[OK]
	* Display Feed		[OK]
	* Feed			[OK]
	* Create 		[OK]
	* Upload images		[OK]
	* Upload from ZIP:	[OK, but little inconvenients (see bellow)]	

	Image Feed is a RSS feed, that you can use for distributing
	Feed or use with APIS for galleries that use these format
	(e.g. Google API for images).

	Please read README_GALLERY, for important information.

	All major bugs are fixed and shouldn't cause problems.

* Videos: OK

	Now with Streaming!!!

	Before, I should mention than I changed the Media Player.
	Now, I used a Player in Examples of Streaming instead
	of Flowplayer.

	Credits and About appears in Player.
	
	In actually, Templates for Gallery index is the same for
	Showcase and Playlist; these display a Thumbnail of a Frame
	of video, using FFMPEG and GD functions (where are available).

	If FFMPEG classes is not available, an alternative image are
	displayed. These are not ready, but is easy to implement;
	create or find a free Image take time.

	Components:

		* Main Showcase	[OK]
		* Playlist	[OK]
		* Player	[OK]
		* Player HQ	[OK]
		* Get Video	[OK]
		* Upload	[Working in them]

	Note: The URL of a Video is parsed as TOKEN, when this is
	a BASE64 encoded of the Filename (with path).
	With Canonical URLs enabled (mod_rewrite), the URI is the
	Token plus the extension '.flv', because many Media players
	don't download or display videos without extension.
	Some Media Players don't display videos if the real extension
	is .php and argument are passed to URL; these vehaviour is
	solvented by enabling Canonical URLs

	The Function parses the Filename into an Array of two values:
	The title (that is displayed), and the Token (base64_encode()
	of the filename, including path).


* Control Panel: OK

	All basic functions operates properly, and other
	functions are in developement.

		* Update config [OK]
			- Sitename
			- Site description
			- User and password
			- phpBB3 path
			- robots.txt

			Note: If 'robots.txt does not exist',
			attemp to create them.
			If is inaccesible, Function don't
			alert to Client, in order to avoid the
			corruption of 'site.ini' file.

		* Manage sections [OK]
			- Edit (Editor) [OK]
			- Delete [OK]

			Note: Home is the only section that
			can't be deleted.


		* Template Edition	[OK]

		* Add section [OK] (see Edit)


		* Backup [OK]

				* Backup	[OK]
				* Restore 	[OK]
				* Template	[OK]

That's all for now. Plase report bugs.
