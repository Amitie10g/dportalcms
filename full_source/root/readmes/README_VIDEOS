If you want to upload Videos or create Playlists
manually, see the following instructions:

1.- To create Playlist:

 * Crate a directory under the directory videos.
   The name should have only one word lowercase,
   without any space or special characters.

 * Inside the directory, create a file called
   ".name". Edit this file with the Title of
   the Playlist, eg "My Playlist".

2.- To upload videos:

 * Upload ONLY Videoflash files. If file type
   is different than any Video Flash formats,
   Script will reject the upload. Title of
   the Video is the Filename, that can have
   any characters; be sure than Encoding of
   fileanme is UTF-8 (or special characters
   will be displayed incorrectly.

These features are the same than Gallery and
Image Upload, and currently I'm working on
them, and ind a next release these features
will be available, in panel and Playlist.

And, be sure than the Video File isn't greater
than the maximum File Upload in your Server.
generally, in free hostings is, for example,
between 5 KiB and 2 MiB. paid Hostings may
have restrictions for Upload (20 MiB for
example), but in Disk have not restrictions
Ã§if file is uploaded throught FTP or CPANEL.
