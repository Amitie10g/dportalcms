=== State of project ===

This program is <<still in developement>> and contain many Bugs,
but currently is suitable for Personal or Community Websites.
Currently, this program have de basic functions to run a Web site
(see Modules bellow). I strongly recommended to don't be use the CMS
in a Production or Comercial Website.


== For people ==

=== Webmasters and administrators ===

If you are a Webmaster, you can setup and manage your Website easily,
and customize the Templates. Please try DPortal CMS and tell me your experience.

=== Developers ===

If you are a Programmer or Web developer, you can contribute the project
by adding enhancements or fixing Bugs. I appreciate it.


== Requisites ==

This program need the following software on the server:

 * Apache 2.0 or later (please, Apache 2.2) or any Webserver
   that support PHP 2.0 or later.
 * php 4.3 or later (I strongly recommended to use php5!).


Modules and Libraries required/optionals:

 * mod_rewrite (recommended, for URL rewrite)
 * GD Library (for the Gallery)
 * zlib library enabled (*)
 * Zip Library (for Backups) (**)
 * MING Library (optional) (***)
 * FFMPEG and PHP module (optional, to generate thumbnails of videos) (****)

	(*) zlib ins included in PHP, but, generally, is not enabled by default.
	Please ask to your Webhosting administrator if zlib is enabled. Otherwise
	you should modify parts of the code to disable zlib functions calling.

	(**) Please see the PHP Documentation about ZIP in
	http://www.php.net/book.zip.html

	You should install Zip via PECL. Please contact with
	your Webhosting administrator for more information.

	Alternatively, if Zip is not available,
	this program use ZLib (available soon).

	(**) MING Library is the Library to manage SWF and FLV files.
	Specifically, this program uses the SWFVideoStream class to
	generate a Streamming Video.

	Unfortunadely, currently this class is undocumented and
	will not be used in current versions.

	Don't worry, the Videos are downloaded by raw_download() function.

	These Library is not a requisite.

	(****) Waining: The Thumbnail generation of a video(s) can "eat"
	huge processor resources in Server, but for once; the image are
	cached and in future visiting, and the image cached is displayed
	instead of calling FFMPEG again.


Also, this program need the following PHP libraries and clases:

=== Smarty Template engine ===

Smrty is included in this package, but I recommend to
download the latest version of them form the oficial
Web stie, http://www.smarty.net.

Smarty class and modules is installed in '/libs/smarty'
directory (relative to package). If you or your Web site
administrator include Smarty as part of the Website and
is included in php include_path, please edit the 'config.php'
file to be include the proper class.

Also, Smarty is included as part of Debian distribution.
Please contact to your Webhosting administrator for details.

Warning: This program was not tested with Smarty3!!!

=== phpBB3 (optional) ===

This program is integrated in phpBB3, the leading Open Source Forum.
You can manage the Website with the Administrator account of phpBB3
instead of the Built-in function.

phpBB3 is not included in this package. You should download
them from the oficial Website (or from cPanel if available) and
configure properly BEFORE install DPortal CMS.

The '/config/site.ini' file contains the phpBBB path, that
the Administrator configure.

eBook, Blog and Main support PDF version.

This program have included a MODIFIED VERSION of FPDF and HTML2FPDF

The version of FPDF included (1.52(modified)) is sufficient to
handle HTML documents properly and you shouldn't consider to update
these libraries yourself. I will provide updates of these programs.
