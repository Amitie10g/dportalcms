DPortal CMS - Installation

DPortal CMS is easy to install. Only upload the contents of the
ZIP file to your Server. The Installer guides your installation,
and in less than minute, your Website is installed and running!

After installing, you should update the code via SVN in order to
have code up to date. This method is more efficient.

svn checkout http://dportalcms.googlecode.com/svn code

Steps:

	* Sitename and Description.
		You must enter a Sitename and Description. The first is
		the Name that appears in Title, and the second is a
		Description for META tags. Be sure to be clearly.

		Also, if your Server supports 'Canonical URLs' with
		mod_rewrite, you can enable them by checking
		the Checkbox.

	* Username and Password.
		You should enter a valid Unsername and Password for
		administration purposes. This is obligatory, but
		if you use phpBB3, the Administrator(s) account(s)
		will be used for administrate 'DPortal CMS'
		instead of the integrated account.

	* phpBB3 (optional)
		If you want to use phpBB3, you should enter the
		Full path of the installation of valid phpBB3,
		with slashes, relative to DOCUMENT_ROOT
		(e.g. '/forum'). phpBB3 adn DPortal CMS SHOULD
		reside in the same server.

		Before installing, I strongly recommended to Login to
		your Forum as Administrator.

And that's all. Enjoy your new Website and please report bugs.
